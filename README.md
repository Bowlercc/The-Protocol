# The-Protocol
A cinematic title card generator for navigating intrusive questions about childlessness. Part of the Matterhood Archive.

# THE PROTOCOL

A cinematic title card generator for the Childless Not By Choice community.

When someone asks *that* question, this tool helps you rewrite the scene. Enter the trigger, select your voice (Diplomat, Critic, Absurdist, or Realist), and generate a response worthy of the moment.

## Features

- **Smart matching** — Regex-powered categorization detects the type of intrusion (unsolicited advice, religious platitudes, blame, legacy guilt, lifestyle judgment)
- **Four voices** — Choose how you want to respond
- **Cinematic export** — Download shareable title cards
- **Gender-specific scripts** — Optional male/female factor perspectives

## Part of Matterhood

Matterhood is a design-led archive documenting life after infertility. No pastels. No baby dust. Just honest, cinematic storytelling about building a legacy without a lineage.
